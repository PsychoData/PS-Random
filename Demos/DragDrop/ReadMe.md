Drag and drop multiple Files/Directories onto the .bat file for each variety. 

I suggest you open [SampleTextFiles](SampleTextFiles) in a separate window so you can drag onto the .bat files easily. 

Try dropping a few directories, a couple individual text files, the entire parent SampleTextFiles directory or all of the folders inside the sample directory at once. If you need something VERY specific, or go through a lot of effort, batch can be handy, but the PowerShell way gives you SO much more versatility. 

## Powershell
Dragging onto the [Demo-Dragdrop-PowershellLauncher.bat](Demo-Dragdrop-PowershellLauncher.bat) will pass all the files and folders selected to [Demo-Dragdrop-Powershell.ps1](Demo-Dragdrop-Powershell.ps1)

## Batch 
Dragging onto the [Demo-DragDrop-batch.bat](Demo-DragDrop-batch.bat) will open all the txt files in notepad. 
Try dragging over **Text 3**,**Text 7**, and **Sample 17**. 

Does it matter which item you click-and-drag on? 

Maybe try selecting **Text 2** and **Sample17** and dragging those over together onto the Batch sample?
